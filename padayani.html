        Padayani, also known Padeni (from the Malayalam word for military formations), is a traditional folk dance and a ritual art[1] from the central portion of the Indian state of Kerala. A ceremonial dance involving masks, it is an ancient ritual performed in Bhagavati temples.[2] The dance is performed in honor of Bhadrakaali.[3] Meaning, a 'row of warriors', Padayani is an art form that blends all music, dance, theatre, satire, facial masks, and paintings. It is part of worship of Bhadrakali and is staged in temples dedicated to the goddess from mid-December to mid-May. Padayani is unique to central Travancore, comprising the Pathanamthitta and kottayam districts of Kerala. Padayani is regarded as a remnant of the Dravidian forms of worship that existed before the advent of Brahmanism.[4]

Padayani is like Theyyam in north Kerala. The percussion instruments used in Patayani are patayani thappu, chenda, para and kumbham.

Padayani at Puthukulangara Devi Temple, Othera, Pathanamthitta District is also famous. Here Bhairavi kolam which is on last day of festival is very famous. For making that 1001 bark of arecanut palm tree is used. Main festival is on star ThiruvathiraMeenamme month of Meena.

"Pachathappu" is the first Malayalam film based on Padayani. Pachathappu is written and directed by Anu Purushoth.Nominated, Kerala Film Critics Award for Best Art Film of 2020
