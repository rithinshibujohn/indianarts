        <p>Theyyam (/t̪eːjjəm/; romanised: teyyam) are Hindu ritualistic dance forms practiced in northern Kerala and some parts of Karnataka. Theyyam is also known as Kaḷiyāṭṭaṁ or Tiṟa. Theyyam consists of traditions, rituals and customs associated with temples and sacred groves of Malabar.[1] The people of the region consider Theyyam itself as a channel to a god and they thus seek blessings from Theyyam.

            In Kasaragod and Kannur districts, this ritual art is mainly performed in the kavus (temples) or ancestral houses of Nambiar, Thiyyar, Vaniyar and Maniyani communities.[2][3]
            
            Theyyam is typically performed by people from castes and tribes like Pulayar, Vannan, Malayan, Anhoottan, Munnoottan, Mavilan, Koppalan, Velan, Chingathan, Kalanaadi, Paravan, Nalikeyavar etc. Of these Kalanaadi people perform only in Wayanad district, while Parava, Pampatha, Nalikeyavar perform in places north of Kerala like Udupi, Krishnapuram etc.[citation needed]
            
            There are about 456 types of Theyyams documented. Theyyam is mainly performed by males, except the Devakoothu theyyam; the Devakoothu is the only Theyyam ritual performed by women.[4] Devakoothu is performed only in the Thekkumbad Kulom temple.[5]
            
            In Kerala, Theyyam is performed predominantly in the North Malabar region (consisting of present-day Kasargod, Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode). A similar custom is followed in the Tulunadu region of neighbouring Karnataka known as Bhuta Kola. </p></div></div></div>
